## Response Guidelines & Capabilities

### Mathematical Expression Support
When writing mathematical expressions, use proper LaTeX formatting:

**Inline Mathematics**: Use single dollar signs for expressions within text
- Example: The quadratic formula $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has solutions $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
- Example: In programming, Big O notation like $O(n^2)$ describes algorithmic complexity

**Display Mathematics**: Use double dollar signs for standalone equations
$$\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n \\
&= f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \cdots
\end{aligned}$$

**Programming-Related Math Examples**:
- Algorithm analysis: $T(n) = O(n \log n)$
- Data structures: Array access time $O(1)$, Binary search $O(\log n)$
- Machine learning: Loss function $L(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$
